# <In-Or-Out>

## Description

This application has been built collaboratively within a context of a Pandemic. During the pandemic, many of us saw ourselves limited to indoor activities at our homes, which created the challenge of how to spend our time and entertain with less social activity. Also, at present, COVID-19 cases have decreased and restrictions are being lifted. This means businesses are reopening and social gatherings are becoming more common.

As demand for social activities increase, there is the opportunity to help people find or choose what they want to do and reconnect with their friends, families and passions.

1. This web application will allow users to first choose if they want to stay inside or if they want to go outside. 
2. Once chosen, the application will display a set of activity cards and present the user with preference buttons to filter activites.
3. Once filtered, the list of activities will be narrowed down. From this short list the user will be able to select an activity by cliking on the card.
4. Once an activity is selected, the user will be presented with more details about that specific activity.
5. If logged in, the user will be allowed to comment on the specific activity comments section and to see what other users have commented.

The USER STORY goes as follow

    AS A user
    I WANT an application that will generate possible ideas of activites
    SO THAT I can have options of things to do, spending more time doing and enjoying rather than choosing.
